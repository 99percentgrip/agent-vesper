## Paper Types Beyond Empirical ML

The main pipeline above targets empirical ML papers. Other paper types require different structures and evidence standards. See [references/paper-types.md](references/paper-types.md) for detailed guidance on each type.

### Theory Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Preliminaries (definitions, notation) → Main Results (theorems) → Proof Sketches → Discussion → Full Proofs (appendix)

**Key differences from empirical papers:**
- Contribution is a theorem, bound, or impossibility result — not experimental numbers
- Methods section replaced by "Preliminaries" and "Main Results"
- Proofs are the evidence, not experiments (though empirical validation of theory is welcome)
- Proof sketches in main text, full proofs in appendix is standard practice
- Experimental section is optional but strengthens the paper if it validates theoretical predictions

**Proof writing principles:**
- State theorems formally with all assumptions explicit
- Provide intuition before formal proof ("The key insight is...")
- Proof sketches should convey the main idea in 0.5-1 page
- Use `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}` environments
- Number assumptions and reference them in theorems: "Under Assumptions 1-3, ..."

### Survey / Tutorial Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Taxonomy / Organization → Detailed Coverage → Open Problems → Conclusion

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is the organization, synthesis, and identification of open problems — not new methods
- Must be comprehensive within scope (reviewers will check for missing references)
- Requires a clear taxonomy or organizational framework
- Value comes from connections between works that individual papers don't make
- Best venues: TMLR (survey track), JMLR, Foundations and Trends in ML, ACM Computing Surveys

### Benchmark Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Task Definition → Dataset Construction → Baseline Evaluation → Analysis → Intended Use & Limitations

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is the benchmark itself — it must fill a genuine evaluation gap
- Dataset documentation is mandatory, not optional (see Datasheets, Step 5.11)
- Must demonstrate the benchmark is challenging (baselines don't saturate it)
- Must demonstrate the benchmark measures what you claim it measures (construct validity)
- Best venues: NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks track, ACL (resource papers), LREC-COLING

### Position Papers

**Structure**: Introduction → Background → Thesis / Argument → Supporting Evidence → Counterarguments → Implications

**Key differences:**
- Contribution is an argument, not a result
- Must engage seriously with counterarguments
- Evidence can be empirical, theoretical, or logical analysis
- Best venues: ICML (position track), workshops, TMLR
